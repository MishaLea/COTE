                    Travelling to The Gambia takes only a short time, considering the tropical climates.
                    Major airlines that fly weekly: Brussels Airlnes (Brussels to Banjul), Vueling (Barcelona to
                    Banjul),
                    Gambia Experience (London to Banjul - via Senegal), AirMaroc (Morocco to Banjul).
                    Banjul International Airport is located in Old Yundum, just 30 minutes drive to Senegambia and 40

                <p>
                    With Senegalese borders all around The Gambia, travelling by road is a popular choice. The journey
                    can take up to 8 hours, going through
                    several suburban towns and villages. For a shorter trip, it's recommended taking the ferry from
                    Barra to Banjul.
                    The longer route is to use the Trans-Gambia Highway which leads you north-south of the country. On
                    to Senegal.
